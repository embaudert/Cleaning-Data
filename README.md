# Cleaning of gyroscope data

Disclaimer: I am not even sure whether I got the exercise correct or what was the expected outcome is. I did it as good as I could, when it is wrong, please inform me what the instructors actually wanted. Thank you!

## Files

* ```CodeBook.md``` Explanation of the script, what the lines are doing and which data the different variables hold.
* ```tidy_data.txt``` The final tidied data set as wanted in the exercise
* ```activity_name.R``` Script holding a function which replaces the names of the activities. As soon as I found out which activity from WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING belongs to which number, the names "Activity X" in this file can be replaces by the actual names of the activity.
* ```run_analysis.R``` The script performing the data manipulation and cleaning as wanted in the exercise (See CodeBook for further details)
